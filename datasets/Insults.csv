"Alright I'm sorry that in my fit of internet rage I cussed you out, I'm sure you're a stand up guy out in meatspace. However I think you're missing the point of my argument. The point I'm trying to convey is that the majority of women (especially the demographic of women likely to be posting on reddit) don't like being objectified over and over and over again, because after a while it makes them feel like objects. Which is exactly what happens when you get sleazy come-ons over and over. This comic nails it, and in this scenario you are the husband on the bed in the last frame. If we truly care about the women we profess to love, we need to try to understand them better and respond to them better for *their benefit*, not ours.

If you care so much about what people whom you don't know think then maybe not commenting is better suited for you. I don't post much here but have been on digg for years.

You must be have got me confused me someone else. I have already cogently demonstrated that the US is primarily responsible for the appalling social conditions in middle east and central asia. Your entire response to this has been to dig your thick head into sand because it conflicts with your moronic Eurocentric agenda and make up retarded strawmen like this. Its quite disappointing. >I don't support either war jackhole. My original statement pointed out that people who think they are free are only as free as their laws allow them to be. That's true in every society on Earth including the West. Further laws aren't the only form of social control. Bullying and harassment are very common tools to get people to conform to the West and they leave deadly legacies. To ignore this is pure idiocy. >Religious laws regarding free choice in Muslim society are far more restrictive than those of the West. . You can blame the West or you can look at why this religion (and other religions) spend all their efforts controlling people. Except most of those repressive Religious Laws are enforced by regimes propped up by the West (eg Saudi Arabia) or those that were desperate social reactions to decades of brutal Western hegemony (eg. Iran). Simply ignoring this isn't doing you any favors. Repressive laws aren't inherent to Islam, they are only a manifestations of the extreme and radical elements which the West has been nurturing and supporting for the past few decades. Afghanistan prior to the disastrous American interference in its affairs in the late 70s and 80s demonstrates how Islam can be interpreted to create open, modern and progressive societies and how destructive Western hegemony can be socially. But such a nuanced view of history and Islam clashes with the convenient, self-serving ""ISLAM CAUZES ALL EVILZ"" narrative propagated by Western establishments which you have mindlessly swallowed. By attributing these regressive social conditions entirely on Islam and not the Western hegemony which predominantly gave rise to it you people get to avoid taking responsibility for your collective role in fomenting the whole mess and can keep in place your neo-imperialistic, hegemonic foreign policies. Here's my advice. Take responsibility for your collective fuck ups, stop foisting the blame on others and get the hell out of the affairs of other countries. 9/11 should have been enough of a lesson but America in modern times seems to be populated by fat, ignorant, irresponsible morons like you incapable of even an iota of independent and critical thinking.

"Wikileaks - The Tel Aviv Connection by Jeff Gates What is Tel Aviv to do now that it's known Israelis and pro-Israelis 'fixed' the intelligence that induced the U.S. to war in Iraq? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Con me consistently for six decades and the relationship is over, as is Israel's credibility as a legitimate nation state. Tel Aviv knows this. But what can the Zionist state do about it? Answer: Wikileaks. Why now? Misdirection. Shine the spotlight on Washington to take it off Tel Aviv. That's good old-fashioned psy-ops. And challenge the credibility of the U.S. That's Wikileaks. Any credible forensics would start by asking: to whose benefit? Then look to means, motive and opportunity plus the presence of stable nation-state intelligence inside the U.S. Other than Israel, who else is a credible candidate? Notice how quickly Israel's role in the peace process vanished from the news. Now it's Iran, Iran and more Iran. To whose benefit? Tel Aviv knows that the phony intelligence on Iraq leads to those skilled at waging war ""by way of deception"" - the motto of the Israeli Mossad. Wikileaks are noteworthy for what's missing: the absence of any material damaging to Israeli goals. But still Tel Aviv faces an unprecedented peril: transparency. Americans know they were duped. And Israel rightly fears that Americans will soon realize by whom. Tepid Support will not Suffice Obama has behaved as anticipated by those who produced his presidency. Anyone surprised at the lack of change in U.S. policy in the Middle East fails to grasp the power of the Israel lobby. Did he hesitate to support their latest Israeli strategy for scuttling peace negotiations? Absent peace, the U.S. will continue to be the target of those outraged at America's unflinching support for Israel's thuggish behavior in pursuit of its expansionist goals. Confirming the lobby's influence, Netanyahu announced he would not agree to halt settlements on Palestinian land until Obama reduced to writing a $3 billion bribe. In return for a proposed 90-day freeze, what form of bribe will America provide? Twenty F-35 jets at $150 million each plus parts, maintenance, training and armaments. That's $231 million per week or $1,373,626 per hour. What will the U.S. receive in return? A temporary partial freeze on settlements. How many more times can this ruse work? Israel has evaded a peace agreement since it drove Palestinians from their land in 1948 and seized more land in 1967 to shape today's geopolitics. Should Israel reach an agreement with the Palestinians, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposes a ""comprehensive security agreement."" At what cost no one knows. The U.S. Congress has already budgeted $30 billion for Israel over 10 years. This latest $3 billion is on top of that. That doesn't include the cost to American credibility posed by an offer to veto U.N. recognition of Palestine as a state. And a pledge Never Again to pressure Israel on settlements. Plus the freeze omits East Jerusalem where Tel Aviv insists on moving ahead with new housing starts. Timing Is Everything By scheduling its latest incursion into Gaza between Christmas 2008 and the January 2009 Obama inaugural, Tel Aviv ensured only muted opposition during political down time in the U.S. Thus it came as no surprise to see an agent provocateur operation on Thanksgiving Day 2010 as Israel demolished a West Bank Mosque and a Palestinian village. After seven hours of nonstop talks, Hillary Clinton praised Netanyahu as a ""peacemaker."" In return, he agreed only to ""continue the process."" Meanwhile, U.S. elections marked a major victory for Israel when incoming Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Jewish Zionist, announced that the new majority would ""serve as a check on the Obama administration."" The Israel lobby has good reason to gloat. Confirming ongoing duplicity, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman proclaimed: ""a permanent agreement is impossible."" Wikileaks' release of confidential diplomatic cables provides Israel an opportunity to undermine U.S. relations worldwide while also inflicting lasting damage on U.S. interests in the Middle East. After this, what nation would trust the U.S. to maintain a confidence? In October, Turkey asked that the U.S. not share intelligence with Israel. Now who dares share intelligence with the U.S.? This may signal the beginning of the end for the Obama presidency his domestic policy failures are eclipsed by his failures in foreign policy. This may also signal pre-staging for the 2012 presidential primary with a weakened Obama forced to name Clinton as his running mate or stepping aside so she can lead the ballot. Her 2008 presidential campaign promised recognition of Israel as a ""Jewish state"" and promised an ""undivided Jerusalem as the capital."" Tel Aviv was elated. A second Clinton presidency would ensure another victory for Israel - and no peace. Israeli psy-ops typically serve multiple purposes. Wikileaks is no exception.

I suggested getting yourself out of situations that make you miserable and going for what makes you happy. How you do that depends entirely on your situation. You can either get rid of the shitty things that you're capable of getting rid of and go for the things you can get that make you happy, or you can nitpick posts on reddit.

My bad experiences are not because of something I've done but misunderstandings or people who just don't agree with you and BOOM, downvote. Examples are a comment I posted in a Twilight thread laughing at a magazine article interviewing Robert P. about his role as Edward and how he hated the role. Naturally, every single negative thing posted in that entire thread including mine was downvoted to oblivion by raging Tweenies. Another thread I posted a link trying to disprove the stereotypes that people have about pitbulls, but commented I would PERSONALLY never own one nor trust them around my own children. Downvoted for..who knows why, someone even called me a moron.

"In everyday life I'm a pretty chill person, but when I read the absurd headlines and comments that have tons of upvotes I can't resist the urge to argue a counterpoint. In fact, that's about 90% of the reason I keep coming here because I disagree with just about every hivemind opinion here and I enjoy debating the arguments in my head. Sometimes it becomes necessary to speak up when a circlejerk is in progress, if only for the silent minority out there who also disagree but feel threatened by the ignorant pricks who have no original thoughts of their own. For example, how many people actually think about what Jon Stewart says before parroting his opinions as their own? How many times do we have to repeat the same tired memes or read a hundred lame jokes before getting to the handful of insightful comments? Also, picking out one particular instance where the vocal majority are wrong is an exercise in futility. If you're not militantly atheist, politically left-wing or libertarian, or don't abuse drugs then you're in the same boat as the women here. Hell, if you hold a nuanced opinion about ANYTHING you are going to catch flak for it. It's not unique to reddit- it's human nature through cognitive bias. The intolerance cuts many ways and yes, the ""community"" would do well to grow the fuck up, but that's humanity for you. Try not to let it ruin the cool parts that you enjoy.

It's obvious that the few rich people (colloquially known as *assholes*) are propped up by the toil of the many. The process by which this happens is often occluded in the analysis, which is ironic considering the ubiquity of the methods by which the economic elite take advantage of the poorer. The confusion should be expected in this case, because the medium through which people are disadvantaged is so (intentionally) convoluted that the truth of the matter, when spelled out, seems utterly contrived.

"This will probably get lost in the chatter, but I hope that at least the OP sees it. In my experience, generally speaking, other Redditors are cool for the most part, though I tend to stick mostly to smaller subreddits that relate to topics I'm interested in. The comments or posts that I've made that have been the most severely downvoted have mostly been ones that I've made while either drunk and belligerent or pissed off with an axe to grind - meaning I pretty much deserved those downvotes. Your gender shouldn't really matter on here, but sad to say, it often does get pulled into a debate due to biases that people have, whether consciously or not. I'm likely guilty of it myself occasionally, though I try not to. Of course, in debates that revolve around gender (such as in /r/mensrights or /r/2xChromosomes [I think that's right]), it's pretty much impossible to ignore gender bias, at least to some extent. Oddly enough, the highest upvoted comments I've had, until recently, have mostly been pun comments or jokes playing off of the topic or another comment. Recently, I've been getting a lot of positive response to posts regarding the new TSA procedures, as I've identified myself as an airport security employee, and redditors love getting an inside perspective - though most of the positive response has been in /r/OperationGrabAss and /r/libertarian, where I'm speaking to a sympathetic community. Overall, I see the Reddit community as a bunch of strong-minded and strong-willed (and often highly opinionated) individuals who are largely good people with other's best interests at heart (the Donor's Choose contributions, the Toy Store free for all for the terminally ill little girl that was harshly teased by neighbors, and all of the various ""my [family member/neighbor/friend/etc] has [hardship] and things are tough - Do what you do best"" posts). This community never fails to warm my heart on a regular basis. That said, we're also a community of people who seem to love debate, and are often passionate and emotional about the issues we discuss, and don't always follow reason, even if most debates are reasonable. Honestly, even though I've had my bad experiences here (and I'm sure most people have), I keep coming back because this is simply a great group of people on the whole.

I felt like a jerk asking for it, but it was amazing how many people managed to resurrect themselves by the next time we would call. The problem here is that if someone enters a person as dead, the collector will try to collect from friends, disclosing the debt to them. If a person is alive this is very much against the law.

"Take a look in the mirror. Like what you see most of the time? I hope so. Most people are fundamentally good. Now imagine yourself in a stadium, looking in the mirror.

Some of them are horrifying. Most of them are nice and don't really care about you. Some of them are downright evil and they *will* fuck with your shit just to do it. *Now imagine we're all using the same mirror.* That's Reddit. * * * The Internet is a rough place. The more anonymous you can be, the rougher you can be. Now that we're pushing a half-million users, there isn't a whole lot to distinguish Reddit from /b/, other than the clever-or-stupid usernames. And it's no secret that the collective intelligence of any group is inversely proportional to its size. As a result, the bigger subreddits tend to be completely worthless for discourse. It's gotten worse lately as well; it used to be trolls would argue with you. Now they'll just downvote you. The inverse of this is that the smaller a group, the less anonymous it tends to be. You see the same names over and over and things get less anonymous. The less anonymous places are, the nicer they tend to be. Not finding the ""community"" ""very nice?"" Make your community smaller. I mean, lemme break this down. You're posting using a throwaway... in a subreddit with 328,000 subscribers... to talk shit about people. That's pretty much part of the problem, isn't it?

"I agree. The Internet in general is not a very nice place, overall. There are tiny pockets of niceness here and there, but that's about all there is. Sad to say, but it's probably about all you can ever reasonably expect. I think a lot of people (myself included) would **love** to find a tight-knit Internet community that is friendly, inviting, and non-judgmental. But alas I think that's more of a pipe dream than anything. The closest I've come to that was a couple of WoW guilds, and in the pre-Internet days, a couple of old school BBSes - those were a lot of fun, but still suffered from the occasional jackass joining the group. But then I got burned out on WoW and quit, then got married, then had a kid, and now I have no time for WoW. So there went that. I tried setting up a small message board for myself and a few of my closest friends, but unfortunately my friends prefer to just Facebook everything. I personally don't like Facebook. I don't want to broadcast everything I say to everyone I ever knew, and most of the stuff my Facebook ""friends"" post on FB is garbage anyway. It always seems to devolve back to that whole ""talking more and more about less and less"" thing, which has been an oft-cited criticism of the ""digital age"".","AskReddit","True","0.715418756","INSULT","0.715418756","0.715418756","-1099738740","-1985381676","ignore"

"To address your whole post... well yes, it's mean in here. I think this is mostly because people enjoy arguing. You can't make any statement or assertion on this site without someone challenging it from some angle or another. Essentially they are trolling, politely or otherwise, and it gets nasty from there. I don't think anyone has ever truly attacked me out of the blue -- it always comes from someone who starts with a ridiculous challenge to something I've said, and then commences when they know they have my attention. The most bizarre Reddit fight I've had is a complete douchebag of a guy on /r/Depression who was extremely upset with my advice to someone else. He constantly personally attacked me for not having been as depressed as he was. The irony is that the same guy created a post in another subreddit about how much he hated getting involved in flame wars on Reddit and how much it hurt his feelings. Then a day later he deleted all of his vitriolic messages to me. It's shit like this. That's why I left that subreddit -- I discovered it was more for people to bitch about their lives than it was to find a way out of depression. And that brings me to my last point, which is, stay away from subreddits. I know people typically tell you that subreddits are where the good stuff is, but my experience has been exactly the opposite. Subreddits are where the most groupthink happens on this site. If you agree with the accepted list of views, you get voted up and agreed with; if you express any doubt, no matter how well thought-out your opinion may be, you get downvoted and shat on. For instance, /r/RelationshipAdvice is a great place...to get horrible advice about relationships and get yelled and screamed at by hopeless romantics and people who think they have all the answers because their girlfriend hasn't left them yet. And then there is what I call ""subreddit bombing,"" where someone will link to a thread in another subreddit and ask the community to punish them with threats, trolling, and downvotes. Much as I like /r/Atheism, it's done this quite a few times with posts from /r/Christianity. Worst time it ever happened to me was when I posted something about how the only thing stopping gay people from having a full-blown wedding was the belief that the priest/pastor/officiator had any magical power to change a relationship. It was part of a discussion about how legalizing gay marriage would stimulate the US economy, as though millions of gay people were waiting with tens of thousands of dollars each for the moment when it was legal to have a wedding. Fuck that. You can draw up a will, assign power of attorney in the event of your death or incapacitation, and nothing is stopping you from having a wedding with the only missing component being the legal recognition of the result. In the end, it's not functionally different than a legal wedding. Anyway, some mod at /r/LGBT was so infuriated by my comment that he posted a link to it in his subreddit and demanded that the LBGT members punish me. Again, it's shit like this. All he did in the end was reduce my karma by 90, convince me that he and the members of /r/LGBT were complete and utter fucktards, and that it was not worth my effort to help them achieve legal marriage goals outside of Reddit. They hurt themselves more than they hurt me. So yeah, subreddits FTL. Opinions FTL. Responding to trolls no matter how civil they might seem FTL.","AskReddit","","0.0289038476","INSULT","0.0289038476","0.0289038476","1095203890","-1750217958","ignore"

"I TA'd for a bit in grad school. We did all of the grading. If you go to a large university, your prof probably doesn't grade any papers. The class I TA'd was, in essence, a leftist critique on global trade. My department was fairly radical, and had even been the subject of a lawsuit alleging that we were using state funds to subsidize research and training for leftist causes. The course covered Marxism, basic heterodox thought, and the history of resistance to neo-colonialism. I had republicans in my class, as did the other TAs. We made a conscious effort to control our biases and only grade on the substance of an argument, not the underlying politics. The stupid republicans got the same grade as the stupid lefties. Throughout my academic career, I've never seen any prof/adjunct/TA do otherwise. I wouldn't take it to your Ombudsman's or Dean's office. If your prof has tenure it won't make a lick of difference. That's actually part of the reason that we have tenure, so that professors can engage in politically unpopular work. If you have an issue with his politics, take the email to a leftist campus group. They love that kind of shit. Unless you're in the South (where half of the econ departments are shilling for billionaires), that prof is likely to be the exile of his department anyways, and his professional life probably sucks balls. I mean, he's surrounded by educated people all day, right?

">Buh, you mean your two-paragraph attack on Radix2? Nah, no argument there, he/she can defend themselves. Did you make another point besides that? Perhaps you should make it more clear. Sorry that you can't comprehend such a complicated argument. Radix2 decided his/her position was the only ""sensible"" one by painting those who oppose the death penalty as taking the sensible position. As if his idea of sensible was infallible and those who opposed his position were not sensible. Such an approach is hilarious because it's a self-proclaimed level of grandeur of his own position. A person without the sense to attempt to disguise such a fallacious argument would have probably have put it more like, ""Only smart people are against execution these days."" It's ridiculous. >Ok, I'm not appealing to emotion. You absolutely are. You are attempting to appeal to the emotions of people who may have feelings against the behavior of various countries who are engaged in capital punishment as a means to attack the act of capital punishment. When you bring up X type of government not having it you are projecting the idea that Y government does have it. X governments are, of course, desirable/respectable/etc in your and others' world view while Y governments are not. As if pointing to a country who performs genocide and also performs capital punishment makes the act of capital punishment wrong. Just because a country who performs acts that some people may find deplorable doesn't mean every single act they perform is horrible. Your argument is linking capital punishment with other acts performed by a country. Your argument points someone to look at a X country and compare to a Y country, see every single horrible act they are involved in and then have them think about the fact Y country also engages in capital punishment. It's a clear appeal to emotion. How about having someone address capital punishment on it's face, as an issue, rather than trying to link it with some oppressive regimes so you can appeal the emotion that comes with such a link? If you want to talk capital punishment itself, as an item to be used in the justice system, to deal with criminals who have done the most heinous crimes conceivable, give me a call. If you want to talk capital punishment, as it has been used and abused throughout the history of mankind and how Y country does it and X country doesn't, don't bother; I don't give a fuck how some jackass leader A years ago did whatever the fuck when abusing this approach. All it reminds me of is some dumbass telling me I can't smoke a fucking joint cause some stupid fucking idiot B years ago ran someone over.","politics","True","0.4769491255","INSULT","0.4769491255","0.4769491255","-1868615340","837159032","ignore"

"I have been preaching this for years. I have been in this country since 1985, I was only 4. I have not left the country since then except for 8 months (not continuous) last year. I have noticed this trend since I was 12. However, I only voiced my opinion one time and the feds showed up at my house. So I have kept my mouth shut. It is very much time for the citizens of america to stand in the face of the govt. and ""remind"" them that they work for us, not the other way around. The basic fear that exists in the average spineless american is something that those in power rely on. The fact that you are not willing to sacrifice the small comforts you have to actually make the world a better place is part of the fuel used by corporate america and its govt. cronies to keep the average american in their place, working and in debt until they die. That way, they can effectively stifle personal growth, keep creativity to a minumum, and retard forward progress. All three can destroy the system as it is. The best course of action: organize in your community and boycott large corps. (walmart, att, verizon, merck, amazon, bestbuy). then, if you work at one of these places, arrange a day where no one goes to work. these corporate fat cats would be nothing without the workers. I bet if the people of this country sat at home one day, those corporate assholes would change their tune super fast. and whoever said that thing about multiculturalism brings division, you are wrong. this country was founded on multiculturism...in fact, that is why this country has become so great. so great in fact that people still want to move here even with all the bullshit. so in conclusion, fuck wal-mart, don't use ur cellphone for the internet and only call when you have to, and arrange in ur community to kick the corporations out of your neighborhood (start a community garden, shop from local stores and stay away from the national chain stores). remember what this country was founded on... We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.","politics","True","0.5118502378","INSULT","0.5118502378","0.5118502378","1641693386","-1455488130","ignore"

Major religions are exempted because most people don't look at the same way as these sorts of things (though it should of course.)

"Generally speaking, how was/is your relationship with actual soldiers in Iraq? I was a young (20-21) year old Sergeant in Iraq in ~2005, and I was in charge of logistic combat patrols in the Tikrit AO.

"This is a complex question that deserves a nuanced, erudite answer that I am too drunk to give now. At this moment, I would say that comparing Americans to the French is going to be a source of endless disappointment. Hell, you would even be disappointed if you compared the French to the Germans in the same respects. Anyway, the thing you are missing is that the problems facing America now have been, in a way, centuries in the making. Read Ben Franklin's Autobiography and you will see all of the horse shit wisdom this country was founded upon. For example, the appearance of industriousness is more important than being industrious according to Franklin. And fucking then, let's not forget the Puritans. There are puritanical ideas floating around in America this very day that were never allowed to come to fruition in Europe **because they kicked those assholes out**. Sorry for the drunken rant.

"No it's not ok for people to make a huge mess and leave it- and yes i have seen people do this on purpose for laughs. It's one thing to accidentally drop a few pieces of popcorn around your seat- and something else entirely to throw a whole bag at someone, spill drinks all over and leave open wrappers everywhere. When I have done these things by accident I have told the the staff i was sorry and shown them the mess. As I would if I accidentally made a mess in a restaurant. So yeah- it's their job to clean it but people can be nicer about it. And throw out their own cups and wrappers and boxes. Also when I saw Cloverfield people were throwing up in their seats- including the guy behind us who got some in our hair/clothes. It was DISGUSTING- we felt very bad for the staff having to clean up after these lazy slobs who couldn't even bother to puke in the trash cans and toilets- instead it was on the floor, seats, and sinks.

"So if humans aren't ""rational agents"", and not even agents with ""bounded rationality"" (i.e. rational but with incomplete information), where does this put the majority of the field of economics? Differential equations with sketchy postulates hardly impress most real scientists. Additional question: I've always liked the idea of of taxing salaries and stock sales of 100-millionaires and above at very steep rates. My rationale is that commit that you achieve diminishing returns if you pay a CEO an extra 5 million if he's already making 5 million. It's not like the CEO will work twice as much for twice the pay. Also, it seems that people end up fetishizing wealth because it increases their relative social status, rather than absolute material status. It therefore seems that very progressive taxes are the best way to to get the most bang for your buck from uber-elites. Your thoughts on this perspective?","IAmA","","0.0895091072","INSULT","0.0895091072","0.0895091072","-970316956","-150588379","reject"

"I am the exact same way. I feel so bad for what he puts up with. I tell him to find someone more balanced and he stays. I am a very angry person most of the time. Negative thoughts are all I know.

I just don't know how. He is an amazing man, loves me unconditionally and is very trustworthy. I don't feel I deserve him. I have too much baggage. He should be with someone who is happy, confident, gorgeous....and so on. But he loves me. How do I fix me?
